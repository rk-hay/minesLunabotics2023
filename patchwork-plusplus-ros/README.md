# patchwork-plusplus-ros

This is ROS package of Patchwork++ (@ IROS'22), which is a fast and robust ground segmentation method.

<p align="center"><img src=pictures/patchwork++.gif alt="animated" /></p>

> If you are not familiar with ROS, please visit the [original repository][patchwork++link].

> If you follow the [repository][patchwork++link], you can run Patchwork++ in Python and C++ easily.

## :open_file_folder: What's in this repository

* ROS based Patchwork source code ([patchworkpp.hpp][codelink])
* Demo launch file ([demo.launch][launchlink]) with sample rosbag file. You can execute Patchwork++ simply!

## :package: Prerequisite packages
You may need to install ROS, PCL, Eigen, ...

## :gear: How to build Patchwork++
To build Patchwork++, you can follow below codes.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ colcon build --packages-select patchworkpp --symlink-install
```

## :runner: To run the demo codes
There is a demo which executes Patchwork++ with sample rosbag2 (mcap) file. You can download a sample file with the following command.

> [!TIP]
> Download a sample dataset for ros2: [mcap file download [~540MB] ](https://laesze-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/herno_o365_sze_hu/Eclwzn42FS9GunGay5LPq-EBA6U1dZseBFNDrr6P0MwB2w?download=1)


<details>
<summary> Don't forget to source before ROS commands.</summary>

``` bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```
</details>

Then, you can run demo as follows.
```bash
# Start Patchwork++
$ ros2 launch patchworkpp demo.launch.py  cloud_topic:=/lexus3/os_center/points cloud_frame:=lexus3/os_center_a_laser_data_frame
# Start the bag file
$ ros2 bag play ~/Downloads/lexus3-2024-04-05-gyor.mcap --loop
# Start visualization
$ ros2 launch patchworkpp rviz1.launch.py
```

> [!WARNING]  
> You may need to install mcap support for pre-iron ROS2: `sudo apt install ros-humble-rosbag2-storage-mcap`

## :pushpin: TODO List
- [ ] Update additional demo codes processing data with .bin file format
- [ ] Generalize point type in the source code
- [ ] Add visualization result of demo codes in readme
